####Hello World!

This is the public repository for
[openpsychology.org](http://openpsychology.org).

openpsychology.org was built to help researchers conduct online
research, to give students access to real world data sets, and
to further efforts concerning replication and reproducibility.

If you like what you see, feel free to take it and run with it.

If you spot room for improvement---I'm sure there's plenty---please
let me know and I can make the fix and give you credit too.

Cheers,

William
