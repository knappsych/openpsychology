        <h1>Thanks for considering participating in {{ pretty_name }}.</h1>

        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment was designed to explore whether or not your
            previous and current financial experiences and financial preferences
            are related to academic success. This is an important topic to
            study as indications of risk to attaining academic success, could
            be used to offer students additional services that could help them
            succeed (e.g. peer-accountability groups or specific skills workshops.
        </p>

        <h2>What can you expect:</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment contains several stages. In one stage you'll be asked
            to provide basic demographic information (e.g. age and gender). In
            another stage you'll be asked to indicate how much you agree with 20
            statements about your current and previous financial experiences (e.g.
            while growing up, my caregivers regularly took us out for pizza and / or
            other treats). All of these questions will be general in nature. Thus,
            you won't be asked to divulge your actual income or savings. In another
            stage you'll be asked to indicate which of two options you would prefer
            (e.g. 20$ today or 40$ in one week).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you provide an academic email (e.g. yourname@university.edu), the
            experimenter will contact your registrar's office to access your current
            and future academic records. The data sought include ACT/SAT scores,
            high school GPA, high school rank, college GPA, number of credits attempted,
            number of credits completed, time to degree, and records related to
            academic suspension and dropping out. These data will be stripped of any
            direct personally identifying information. Additionally, these data will be
            transmitted and stored securely. By providing an academic email address, you
            are giving the experimenter explicit permission to access your academic records.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't attend a university, you may still
            participate as we're also interested in determining whether one's
            financial experiences predict one's financial preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you begin the experiment, you should be able to complete it
            within about 15-20 minutes. Please, do not begin the experiment
            unless you expect to be free from distractions for the duration
            of the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should you agree to participate, you'll be sent an email with a
            code you'll need to use to access the actual experiment. This is
            to verify that you are who you say you are.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights:</h2>
        <p>
            You have the right to discontinue participating at any time. For some
            of the demographic questions, you'll have options to not respond, if
            you're uncomfortable providing that information. There are no such
            options to not respond to the questions regarding financial experiences
            and preferences, so if you wish to discontinue, just shut the close
            the webpage. No data will be saved until you've completed the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also have the right to receive more information about this study.
            If you would like more information before consenting, please contact
            the study's primary investigator using the
            <a href="{% url 'experiments:experiments' %}{{ e_name }}/inquiry/">
            inquiry form</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also have the right to learn more about the specific hypotheses
            under investigation in this experiment. At the end of your participation
            you'll receive a debriefing email that will describe some of the specific
            hypotheses and where you can learn more if you're interested.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you believe that any of your rights are violated during the course of
            the experiment, you have the opportunity to contact the chair of the
            <a href="{% url 'experiments:experiments' %}{{ e_name }}/ethics/">Institutional
            Review Board or equivalent</a> of the institution who has approved the
            primary investigator to conduct this research.
        </p>

        <h2>Potential risks:</h2>
        <p>
            There are few anticipated risks to participating. It's possible that you
            might find some of the questions repetitive or boring, but it's also
            possible that you'll find participating to be an enjoyable experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            One potential risk is that your identity could be linked to your individual
            responses. Several steps have been taken to ensure that the probability
            this could occur are minimized. First, your email address is not stored
            with the data you submit, or even with which studies you participate in.
            Your emails are temporarily stored during your participation in order to
            send you debriefing information that can be used to verify that you
            participated. Your email address will also be stored separately from
            any other data to contact you should there be the opportunity for
            follow-up studies or other research opportunities. These emails are
            double password-protected, which provides roughly the same level of
            protection that signing a consent form that's stored in a locked
            cabinet in a locked room provides.
        </p>
        <p>
            In collecting data from your institutions about your academic performance,
            your personally identifying information (e.g. name or address) will
            be removed from the data or transformed so the experimenter can connect
            your experimental data with your academic performance. The experimenters
            will obtain these data manually, so no sensitive information is exposed
            over the internet, or have the data encrypted and/or password protected
            before being electronically submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only the experimenters or their assistants will have access to the raw
            data. Should the results be presented publicly, the data will be
            presented in aggregate form with no information that could be used
            to identify an individual with their performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Potential benefits:</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a college student, some of your professors might offer you
            extra-credit for participating. You can share the debriefing email with
            them as evidence that you successfully completed the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although no direct financial incentives are provided for participating
            in this experiment, your participation will be useful in answering
            important questions about human performance, preferences, and experiences.
            By participating, you'll also gain first-hand experience about what the
            research process is like. This can be useful in deciding whether you might
            be interested in pursuing a research career. You also might find that
            you're particularly interested in some topic. As this experiment is being
            conducted solely online, there's always the possibility that you could
            identify a question of your own that you could investigate using this
            platform. Such inquiries should be directed to Open Psychology using
            our <a href="{% url 'contact' %}/contact/">contact form</a> or to
            the primary investigator using the
            <a href="{% url 'experiments:experiments' %}{{ e_name }}/inquiry/">
            experiment inquiry form</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Your responsibilities:</h2>
        <p>
            Although your participation is completely voluntary, it's important that
            you take this experience seriously. For the questions concerning your
            financial experiences and preferences, the right answers are the honest
            ones. Please consider each statement or option carefully before responding.
            Such conscientious participation, will help to ensure the validity of our
            study and be of greater scientific value. As mentioned before, if at
            any point you prefer to discontinue participation, please do so, as opposed
            to participating without thoughtfully considering the options.
        </p>
