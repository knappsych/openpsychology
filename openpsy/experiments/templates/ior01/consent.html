        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment was designed to see if a classical experimental
            result in participants' response time to different stimuli
            can be reproduced in an online setting using only javascript.
            If it can, that sets the stage for designing other response
            time dependent online experiments to offer instructors and
            students a wider range of experiments to participate in
            online. It would also suggest that new experimental hypotheses
            could be offered on line when traditional experimental
            facilities are lacking or when a wider range of participants
            is desired.
         </p>

        <h2>What can you expect:</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment contains two stages. In the first stage you'll be asked
            to provide basic demographic information (e.g. age and gender). In
            the experimental stage you'll see two grey boxes to the left and the
            right of a fixation cross that you should focus on through the
            duration of the experiment. Your task is to respond as quickly as
            possible by clicking anywhere on the screen when you see a small
            grey square appear in the center of one of the boxes. Additional
            instructions and example stimuli will be provided should you
            consent to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you begin the experiment, you should be able to complete it
            within about 5-10 minutes. Please, do not begin the experiment
            unless you expect to be free from distractions for the duration
            of the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should you agree to participate, you'll be sent an email with a
            code you'll need to use to access the actual experiment. This is
            to verify that you are who you say you are.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights:</h2>
        <p>
            You have the right to discontinue participating at any time. For each
            of the demographic questions, you'll have options to not respond, if
            you're uncomfortable providing that information. No data will be
            saved until you've completed the experiment. Thus if you wish to
            discontinue at any time, you can shut the browser window and move
            on to other activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also have the right to receive more information about this study.
            If you would like more information before consenting, please contact
            the study's primary investigator using the
            <a href="{% url 'experiments:experiments' %}{{ e_name }}/inquiry/">
            inquiry form</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also have the right to learn more about the specific hypotheses
            under investigation in this experiment. At the end of your participation
            you'll receive a debriefing email that will describe some of the specific
            hypotheses and where you can learn more if you're interested.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you believe that any of your rights are violated during the course of
            the experiment, you have the opportunity to contact the chair of the
            <a href="{% url 'experiments:experiments' %}{{ e_name }}/ethics/">Institutional
            Review Board or equivalent</a> of the institution who has approved the
            primary investigator to conduct this research.
        </p>

        <h2>Potential risks:</h2>
        <p>
            There are few anticipated risks to participating. It's possible that you
            might find some of the task repetitive or boring, but it's also
            possible that you'll find participating to be an enjoyable experience.
            If you treat the experiment like a game and try to respond as quickly
            as possible, you should have a more enjoyable experience and provide
            the researcher with better data.
        </p>
        <p>
            One potential risk is that your identity could be linked to your individual
            responses. Several steps have been taken to ensure that the probability
            this could occur are minimized. First, your email address is not stored
            with the data you submit, or even with which studies you participate in.
            Your emails are temporarily stored during your participation in order to
            send you debriefing information that can be used to verify that you
            participated. Your email address will also be stored separately from
            any other data to contact you should there be the opportunity for
            follow-up studies or other research opportunities. These emails are
            double password-protected, which provides roughly the same level of
            protection that signing a consent form that's stored in a locked
            cabinet in a locked room provides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone will have access to the raw data from which your personally
            identifying information will have been removed. If you're interested,
            you can download the data and perform your own analyses.
        </p>

        <h2>Potential benefits:</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a college student, some of your professors might offer you
            extra-credit for participating. You can share the debriefing email with
            them as evidence that you successfully completed the experiment.
            Alternatively, you could take a screenshot at the end of the experiment
            that indicates you're finished. Or, if you leave the experiment and
            later want evidence, you'll receive a page that indicates that you
            already participate, if you reenter your email in this consent form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although no direct financial incentives are provided for participating
            in this experiment, your participation will be useful in answering
            important questions about human performance, preferences, and experiences.
            By participating, you'll also gain first-hand experience about what the
            research process is like. This can be useful in deciding whether you might
            be interested in pursuing a research career. You also might find that
            you're particularly interested in some topic. As this experiment is being
            conducted solely online, there's always the possibility that you could
            identify a question of your own that you could investigate using this
            platform. Such inquiries should be directed to Open Psychology using
            our <a href="{% url 'contact' %}/contact/">contact form</a> or to
            the primary investigator using the
            <a href="{% url 'experiments:experiments' %}{{ e_name }}/inquiry/">
            experiment inquiry form</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Your responsibilities:</h2>
        <p>
            Although your participation is completely voluntary, it's important that
            you take this experience seriously and attempt to perform as well as
            you can. Such conscientious participation, will help to ensure the validity
            of our study and be of greater scientific value. As mentioned before, if at
            any point you prefer to discontinue participation, please do so, as opposed
            to participating without doing your best.
        </p>

        <h2>In participating you agree that:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your participation is voluntary and not coerced.</li>
            <li>You are 18, older, or have your primary caregiver's permission to participate.</li>
            <li>You understand what you'll be asked to do in the experiment.</li>
            <li>You understand the potential risks and benefits of participating.</li>
            <li>To ensure the integrity of the experiment, you will not discuss any of the
            specific questions or hypotheses related to this experiment with anyone who has
            not yet participated in the experiment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you agree to participate, please enter your email. If you agree to be contacted for
